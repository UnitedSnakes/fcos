# FCOS: Fully-Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector

## Introduction
This repository replicates **FCOS (Fully-Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector)**, a one-stage anchor-free object detection model. The implementation follows the structure outlined in the FCOS paper: [FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355).

This project is adapted from Stanford's **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** coursework
